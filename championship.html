              <p>Formula DRIFT (also known as Formula D or 'FD’) is a United States-based motorsport drifting series. Formula DRIFT was co-founded by Jim Liaw and Ryan Sage in 2003 as a sister company to Slipstream Global Marketing, the same partnership that introduced D1 Grand Prix to the United States. The new entity would solely own, operate and launch the first official drifting series in North America. Formula DRIFT is not associated with the FIA series of formula racing championships.</p>
                <p>Formula DRIFT has 84 licensed drivers competing in PRO and PROSPEC (formerly PRO 2[2]) as of June 2024. The series consists of an eight-round championship played out at race tracks across North America. Formula DRIFT is judged on line, angle, and style, rather than who finishes the course in the fastest time.</p>

                <p>As one half of the Red Bull Driftbrothers, Johannes 'Joe' Hountondji is one of drifting’s best-known drivers. He loves the sport, but even he'll tell you that “drifting is not the easiest sport to understand.”</p>
                <p>It is, however, one of the most exciting (and fastest growing) disciplines in motorsport, demanding the perfect balance of speed, style and fearlessness from its drivers. As Joe says, competitors go “man against man, machine against machine, mano a mano, head to head.”
                    With Europe's definitive professional drifting series, the Drift Masters (DM), returning for a new season in 2024, it's the time to learn exactly what the sport entails. This is drifting explained.
