            <p>Drift cars are usually light- to moderate-weight rear-wheel-drive coupes and sedans, offering a large range of power levels. There have also been all-wheel drive cars that have been converted to rear-wheel drive such as the Subaru WRX, Toyota Avensis, Scion tC, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, Dodge Charger, and Nissan GT-R. Early on, AWD cars without conversion were allowed in some drifting competitions, and usually the rules allowed only a certain percentage of power to be sent to the front wheels, but they are banned in most (if not all) drifting competitions today.</p>
          <p>Despite the possibility of obtaining desirable Japanese domestic market vehicles in continents outside Japan, drifters in other countries prefer to use local versions of the same cars (for example, a Nissan 240SX instead of a Nissan Silvia S13, etc.), or even domestic cars. A high volume of Japanese imports were brought to countries such as Australia and New Zealand, however it is not unusual to see Australian/New Zealand domestic vehicles such as the Holden Commodore or Ford Falcon used in drifting competitions.</p>

           <h1 id="cars">Championship</h1>
            <p>Drifting is such a unique sport that it's difficult to really define it, but it's probably best described as precise car driving whilst in a controlled slide. That doesn't sound very exciting, right? However, when you realise that drifters have made a sport out of the thing that the average driver fears the most – skidding – everything looks very different. Essentially, it's all about using oversteer to get the vehicle to drive sideways through corners at high speed while the driver remains in full control of the car.</p>
          <p>The essence of competition drifting is driving in pairs on a specifically designated route, with the goal to show the ability to perfectly control a sideways car whilst under the constant pressure of the rival.
